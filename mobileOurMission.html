    <div style="font-size: 4vh; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Our Mission and Vision</div>
    <div id = "mobilemissioninfo">Grafite is a small nonprofit startup founded by students for students. Our mission is to provide aid to students around the world in order to help them reach their academic — and thereby total — potential. To this end, we strive to help out schools in need through various <a href="./mobileServices.html">services</a>, whether it be by providing them with school supplies or working hands on with the students themselves.
          <br><br>
          Grafite is entirely not-for-profit. One hundred percent of the profit we acquire is put towards providing more students with the supplies they deserve. All of Grafite's revenue comes from various fundraising efforts, and we also collect supplies directly through drives. Grafite is serviced fully by its executive <a href="./mobileTeam.html">team</a> and other volunteers. Our company is based in New Jersey, but as we grow, we strive to include members from across the globe.
          <br><br>
          Our two co-presidents, Keaton Hawkins and Eriksen Sandaire were inspired to work towards achieving Grafite’s mission after witnessing firsthand the lack of access to quality materials that many school districts outside of our hometown experience. We envision a future in which no student is limited by anything other than their creative potential, and with your help, we can make that vision a reality.
