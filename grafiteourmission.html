    <h1 id = "missionheader">Our Mission and Vision</h1>
    <div id = "missioninfo">Grafite is a small nonprofit startup founded by students for students. It is run by four primary executive officers, all of whom are high school students, and many other high school volunteers. You can find information about our executive officers in the “Team” section of our site. Our mission is to provide aid to students around the world in order to help them reach their academic — and thereby total — potential. To this end, we strive to help out schools in need, whether it be by providing them with school supplies or working hands on with the students themselves. To find out more about what it is we do specifically, visit the “Services” section of our website.
      <br><br>
    Grafite is entirely not-for-profit. One hundred percent of the profit it acquires is put towards providing more students with the supplies they deserve. All of Grafite’s revenue comes from various fundraising efforts, including but not limited to bake sales and charity dinners. We also collect supplies directly through drives. Grafite is serviced fully by volunteers. Our company is based in New Providence, New Jersey, but as we grow, we strive to include members from other communities too.
      <br><br>
    Our two co-presidents, Keaton Hawkins and Eriksen Sandaire were inspired to work towards achieving Grafite’s mission after witnessing firsthand the lack of access to quality materials that many school districts outside of our home town experience. We envision a future in which no student is limited by anything other than their creative potential, and with your help, we can make that vision a reality.
